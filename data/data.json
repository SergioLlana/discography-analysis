Woah, ah\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end\nKeep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes\nUnfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days\nGreat escape, lost track of time and space\nShe's a silver lining climbing on my desire\n\nAnd I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be\nAnd satisfaction feels like a distant memory\nAnd I can't help myself, all I\nWanna hear her say is \"Are you mine?\"\nWell, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)\nAre you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)\nAre you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)\n\nAnd the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways\nSo in case, I'm mistaken, I\nJust wanna hear you say, \"You got me, baby\nAre you mine?\"\nShe's a silver lining\nLone ranger riding through an open space\nIn my mind when she's not right there beside me\n\nAnd I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be\nAnd satisfaction feels like a distant memory\nAnd I can't help myself, all I\nWanna hear her say is \"Are you mine?\"\nWell, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)\nAre you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)\nAre you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)\n(Or just mine tonight?)",
