Sectoral heterochromia\n\nAviation in the evening, I can feel it coming on\nMama told me, you should start as you mean to go wrong\nOr else you\u2019re never gonna get it right\n\nSe\u00f1orita, well you need not come coke-head close to me\n'Cause I can hear you perfectly clear from here\n\nAviation in the evening, I can feel it coming on\nMama told me, you should start as you mean to go wrong\nOr else you\u2019re never gonna get it right\nElementary Hallelujahs, Annalise\u2019s dulcet tone\nAviation in the evening, I just can\u2019t leave it alone\nI reckon I just might have broke the ice\n\nThe Colourama in your eyes, it takes me on a moonlight drive\nIt\u2019s the way you wing it while you\u2019re figuring it out",
