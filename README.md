# Discography Analysis

The main purpose of this repository is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the discography of a band, applying multivariate analysis and natural language processing techniques.

As a first experiment, data from Genius and Spotify APIs have been merged in order to create a data set with Arctic Monkeys' songs, which have been stored both in JSON format and in a Mongo DB database.
