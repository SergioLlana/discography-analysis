She could have anyone she wants\nAnd I'm struggling to think of an immediate response\nLike, \"I don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait\nAnd let me waste your time\nReally, love, it's fine\"\nI said, \"Really, love, it's fine\"\n\n\nAnd then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy\nI knew before the invitation that there was this ploy\nOh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse\nShe said, \"It's the red wine this time,\" but that is no excuse",
